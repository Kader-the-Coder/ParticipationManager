A Java-based desktop application designed to simplify tracking student attendance, participation, and behavior. The tool replaces manual Excel tracking with an easy-to-use graphical interface.

## Features
- Mark students as **Present**, **Absent**, or **Late**.
- Track student **behavior** and **participation**.
- Maintain records by **grades** and **subjects**.
- Export or review historical attendance and participation data (planned).
